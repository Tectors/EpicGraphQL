# EpicGraphQL

Research about Epic's non-documented Graphql API. Documentation can be found within the [docs](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/tree/main/docs) folder.

--------------

### How did you find these?
  Most of the documented information is from the [offical website](https://www.epicgames.com/) and taken from Network inside Developer tools, then taken into a python script which will parse them into different folders and seperate files for the GraphQL.
  
  *If you are willing to add anything, make sure to make a new [pull request](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/pulls) and I'll see what it contains and if it can be added into the documentation.*
  
  **Ways to find requests**:
  <br> It can be done in multiple ways such as, using Developer Tools recording each request and using a [script](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/tree/main/scripting) or finding each request yourself, or you could download a old [Fortnite Party Hub](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/party-hub-faq) version which I have many and use a program like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) to see each request.

### What if I need support?

  If there is help needed, search throughout the documentation and find the related information you are needing, if something is missing and you want to contribute make sure to, fork, create your changes, and make a [pull request](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/pulls) explaining what you've contributed. 
  
  There is something that we should of added? Well then make a [issue](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/issues) and tell us what we are missing that we should of added and I'll see if it can be added into the documentation.
  
  **How can I talk to you or other people that can help me?**:
  <br> You can make a [issue](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/issues) that can be easily accessed at the repository and get answers, if available.
