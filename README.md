Research about the [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/)'s non-documented offically, Graphql API and main API, help and information at the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CPg9G9e22v).

# How did you find these?

  Most of the documented information is from the [offical website](https://www.epicgames.com/) and taken from Network inside Developer tools, then taken into a python script which will parse them into different folders and seperate files for the GraphQL.
  
  *If you are willing to add anything, make sure to make a new [pull request](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/pulls) and I'll see what it contains and if it can be added into the documentation.*
  
  **Ways to find requests**:
  <br> It can be done in multiple ways such as, using Developer Tools recording each request and using a [script](https://github.com/Tectors/EpicGraphQL/tree/main/scripting) or finding each request yourself, or you could download a old [Fortnite Party Hub](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/party-hub-faq) version which I have many and use a program like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) to see each request.

# What if I need support?

  **How can I talk to you or other people that can help me?**:
